# High-Fidelity Design Progress - COMPLETED ✅

## 🎯 UX Design Requirements Analysis

### Core Design Principles Applied
✅ **Minimalist with Purpose**: Clean interfaces with strategic whitespace and clear information hierarchy  
✅ **Component Consistency**: Reusable design patterns across all screens using established design tokens  
✅ **Performance-First**: Lightweight CSS using existing design system, optimized animations   
✅ **Accessibility Ready**: WCAG AA compliance, semantic HTML, proper focus states  
✅ **Developer-Focused UX**: Code-friendly patterns (Monaco fonts, JSON viewers, technical language)  

### Color System Implementation
✅ **Primary**: Indigo (#6366f1) - maintained for CTAs and interactive elements  
✅ **Surfaces**: Multi-layered surface system with subtle gradients for depth  
✅ **Status Colors**: Semantic green/red/yellow for success/error/warning states    
✅ **Typography**: Inter + JetBrains Mono combination for clean technical aesthetic
