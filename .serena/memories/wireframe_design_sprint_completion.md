# RocketHooks Wireframe Design Sprint - Completed

## Summary
Successfully completed a comprehensive wireframe design sprint for the RocketHooks webhook management platform, creating 11 HTML/CSS wireframes covering the entire user journey from authentication to system configuration.

## Context
- **Issue #34**: Design System Foundation implementation
- **Product Brief**: Developer-first SaaS for transforming legacy APIs into real-time webhooks
- **Design Approach**: Clean, minimalist, grayscale wireframes with strategic color indicators

## Completed Deliverables

### Wireframes Created (11 total)
All files located in `/mockups/wireframes/`:

1. **01-signup-split.html** - OAuth sign-up with 60/40 split screen (value prop + auth)
2. **02-create-organization.html** - Post-auth organization setup wizard
3. **03-dashboard.html** - Main dashboard with metrics and activity feed
4. **04-apis-list.html** - API management card grid
5. **05-add-api-form.html** - Multi-step API configuration modal
6. **06-webhooks-list.html** - Webhook destinations table view
7. **07-add-webhook-form.html** - Webhook configuration form
8. **08-events-stream.html** - Real-time event monitoring with split panel
9. **09-transformations.html** - Data transformation pipeline builder
10. **10-logs.html** - System logs viewer with filtering
11. **11-settings.html** - Multi-section settings management

### Documentation
- **SCREENS_INVENTORY.md** - Initial planning with 42 screens identified
- **WIREFRAMES_SUMMARY.md** - Comprehensive documentation of all wireframes

## Key Design Decisions

### Layout Patterns
- **Sidebar navigation**: 240px fixed width
- **Split-panel layouts**: Events and logs screens
- **Card-based grids**: APIs, webhooks, transformations
- **Modal overlays**: Configuration forms
- **Table views**: Webhooks, logs, API keys

### Visual System
- **Colors**: Grayscale base with semantic colors (Green for success, Red for error, Orange for warning)
- **Typography**: System fonts with Monaco for code
- **Spacing**: Consistent padding/margins throughout
- **Status indicators**: Badges, dots, progress bars

### User Experience Patterns
- **Progressive disclosure** in multi-step forms
- **Immediate feedback** with test connections
- **Real-time updates** with live indicators
- **Bulk operations** with multi-select
- **Search and filtering** at multiple levels

## Next Steps for Development

1. **High-Fidelity Design Phase**
   - Apply brand colors (Indigo #6366f1 primary)
   - Add Lucide React icons
   - Implement actual charts (Chart.js/Recharts)
   - Create loading and empty states

2. **Component Development**
   - Build React components based on wireframes
   - Implement with ShadcN UI library
   - Create Storybook documentation

3. **Additional Screens Needed**
   - Error pages (404, 500)
   - Email notification templates
   - Public status page
   - API documentation viewer
   - Mobile responsive versions

## Technical Notes
- All wireframes are static HTML/CSS files
- Designed for 1440px minimum desktop width
- Follow WCAG AA accessibility guidelines
- Ready for React component conversion

## Important Context
The wireframes represent the complete MVP scope for RocketHooks, enabling developers to:
- Monitor legacy APIs for changes
- Configure webhooks for real-time events
- Transform data between sources and destinations
- Debug with comprehensive logging
- Manage team and organization settings

This design sprint establishes the foundation for the RocketHooks design system as specified in issue #34.
