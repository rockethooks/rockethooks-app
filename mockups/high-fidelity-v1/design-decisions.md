## üèóÔ∏è **Core Design Principles**

### 1. **Technical Elegance**
- **Clean, minimal interface** that doesn't distract from complex technical workflows
- **Monospace fonts for code** (JetBrains Mono) to enhance readability
- **Subtle gradients and shadows** that add depth without overwhelming
- **Professional color palette** that conveys trust and reliability

### 2. **Accessibility First**
- **WCAG AA compliant** color contrast ratios
- **Focus states** with clear visual indicators
- **Reduced motion** support for users with vestibular disorders
- **High contrast mode** compatibility
- **Semantic HTML** structure for screen readers

### 3. **Progressive Disclosure**
- **Information hierarchy** through typography and spacing
- **Progressive revelation** of complex features
- **Clear visual pathways** through the interface
- **Contextual help and feedback**

## üéØ **Color Strategy**

### Primary Palette
- **Primary**: `#6366f1` (Indigo) - As required, used for primary actions and brand elements
- **Primary Light**: `#8b5cf6` (Purple-ish) - For gradients and hover states
- **Primary Dark**: `#4338ca` - For pressed states and emphasis

### Secondary Palette
- **Grays**: Sophisticated slate grays (`#0f172a` to `#f8fafc`) for text and surfaces
- **Surfaces**: Subtle gradients between whites and light grays for depth

### Semantic Colors
- **Success**: `#10b981` (Emerald) - For successful operations, active states
- **Warning**: `#f59e0b` (Amber) - For warnings, pending states
- **Error**: `#ef4444` (Red) - For errors, failed states
- **Info**: `#3b82f6` (Blue) - For information, neutral states

## ‚ú® **Visual Language**

### Typography
- **Primary**: Inter - Modern, highly legible sans-serif for UI text
- **Monospace**: JetBrains Mono - For code blocks, API endpoints, technical data
- **Scale**: Carefully crafted 14-step scale from 12px to 48px
- **Weights**: 400 (Normal), 500 (Medium), 600 (Semibold), 700 (Bold)

### Spacing System
- **8px base unit** with logical progression
- **Consistent spacing** using CSS custom properties
- **Responsive spacing** that scales appropriately
- **Optical alignment** for visual balance

### Border Radius
- **Subtle curves** (2px-16px) for modern feel
- **Contextual sizing** - smaller for buttons, larger for cards
- **Full radius** for pills and avatar elements

## üß© **Component Architecture**

### Layout Components
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Fixed width (260px) with elegant hover states
- **Main Content**: Flexible grid system with proper spacing
- **Cards**: Rounded corners, subtle shadows, hover animations
- **Tables**: Clean, stripe-less design with hover states

### Interactive Elements
- **Buttons**: Multiple variants with gradient backgrounds and hover effects
- **Form Fields**: Consistent styling with focus rings and validation states
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded with animated dots for real-time feedback

### Micro-interactions
- **Hover States**: Subtle transformations (translateY, scale)
- **Loading States**: Animated spinners and skeleton screens
- **Transitions**: 150ms-300ms for smooth, responsive feel
- **Animations**: Purposeful, enhancing UX without distraction
