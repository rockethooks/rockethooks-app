## Technical Requirements

### File Structure
```
/mockups/high-fidelity-v[X]/
  ├── css/
  │   ├── design-system.css  (your core system)
  │   └── components.css      (reusable components)
  ├── 01-signup-split.html
  ├── 02-create-organization.html
  ├── [... all 11 screens]
  └── design-decisions.md     (explain your approach)
```

### CSS Architecture
- Use CSS custom properties for your design tokens
- Create reusable utility classes
- Ensure responsive behavior (desktop-first)
- Include print styles for logs/reports

### Documentation Required
Create `design-decisions.md` explaining:
1. Your color philosophy
2. Typography reasoning
3. Key differentiators from other approaches
4. Accessibility considerations
5. Future scalability thoughts

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] All 11 screens completed
- [ ] Consistent design language across all screens
- [ ] Hover states for all interactive elements
- [ ] Loading states demonstrated
- [ ] Empty states shown where applicable
- [ ] Dark mode considered (even if not fully implemented)
- [ ] Mobile responsive (at least for critical screens)
- [ ] Design decisions documented

## Evaluation Criteria
Your design will be evaluated on:
1. **Visual Cohesion** - How well the screens work together
2. **Developer Appeal** - Does it feel right for the target audience?
3. **Usability** - Clear hierarchy and intuitive interactions
4. **Innovation** - Creative solutions within constraints
5. **Production Readiness** - How easily could this be implemented in React?
6. **Personality** - Does it stand out while remaining professional?

## Time Expectation
Complete all 11 screens with your unique design vision. Do NOT review other parallel implementations until all versions are complete.

## Final Note
Remember: We want to see YOUR interpretation. Don't play it safe - push boundaries while respecting the core requirements. Whether you go minimal, bold, playful, serious, or somewhere in between, make it distinctly yours.
